# GroupMatcher: Assignment Group Matcher

## iOS App for students, who are looking for perfect teammates for uni work.

This iOS application is created for students who want to team up with like-minded people and succeed in assignments. It helps to find a perfect match for particular assignment tasks. GroupMatcher analyses skills of all students from the same subject and suggests the best candidates for creating the most powerful and versatile team. To make it for fun, students can learn about each other's personal interests before joining the team. If your goal is an HD, share it through your profile, and you will see only matches with the same level of commitment as you. No more slackers chasing!
